   - `[insert core focus]`, `[model]`, `[list packages]`, `[unique selling point]`: Add specifics about EfeNexus Pi (e.g., "real-time data analysis," "Pi 4," "python3-pip git").
   - Update the banner image URL (e.g., upload a custom image to the repo and link it like `/images/banner.png`).

2. **Visuals**:
   - The placeholder banner (`https://via.placeholder.com/800x200.png?text=EfeNexus+Pi+Banner`) can be swapped for a custom graphic. Use a tool like Canva or GIMP to create one.

3. **Badges**:
   - The `Build Status` and `License` badges are examples. Customize them via [shields.io](https://shields.io) based on your project‚Äôs actual status.

4. **Content**:
   - Tailor "What‚Äôs It About?" and "Features" to reflect EfeNexus Pi‚Äôs purpose (e.g., IoT, AI, strategy gaming).
   - If it‚Äôs not a Raspberry Pi project, adjust references accordingly (e.g., "Powered By: Arduino").
