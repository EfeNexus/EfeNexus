## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Efe Nexus Pi, please report it to us privately to allow time for a fix before public disclosure. Follow these steps:

1. **Do Not Open Public Issues**: Avoid reporting vulnerabilities via public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests, as this could allow exploitation before a fix is ready.
2. **Contact Us**: Email us at [efenexuspi@gmail.com](efenexuspi@gmail.com) with the following details:
   - **Type of Issue**: E.g., buffer overflow, XSS, privilege escalation.
   - **Location**: The affected component or source file (e.g., tag, branch, or commit).
   - **Description**: A detailed explanation of the vulnerability.
   - **Reproduction Steps**: How to trigger the issue, if applicable.
   - **Impact**: Potential consequences of the vulnerability.
   - **Optional Configuration**: Any specific setup needed to reproduce the issue.
3. **Use Encryption (Optional)**: If you prefer, encrypt your report using our public key (available upon request).

## Response Process

- **Acknowledgment**: We will confirm receipt of your report within 2 business days.
- **Triage**: We will assess the severity and impact within 7 days and prioritize a fix.
- **Fix and Disclosure**: We aim to release patches for critical issues within 30 days. We will coordinate with you on public disclosure, crediting you (if desired) once a fix is deployed.
- **Declined Reports**: If we determine the issue is not a valid vulnerability, we will explain our reasoning.

## Scope

This policy applies to the Efe Nexus Pi repository hosted at [github.com/username/efe-nexus-pi](https://github.com/username/efe-nexus-pi). Third-party dependencies are outside our scope; please report issues to their respective maintainers.

## Responsible Disclosure

We ask that you:
- Give us reasonable time to address the issue before disclosing it publicly.
- Avoid exploiting vulnerabilities beyond what is needed to demonstrate the issue.
- Refrain from accessing or modifying user data or systems unnecessarily.

## Recognition

We appreciate security researchersâ€™ efforts and may acknowledge your contribution in our release notes or a hall of fame (with your permission).
